# Agent-based modelling of the effect of poaching on elephants in Eastern Africa using Netlogo
Wildlife poaching is the illegal hunting and killing of wild animals. Poaching occurs worldwide, with 
thousands of animal species on the target list. In the continent currently, Poaching is a 
widespread problem, it is moving at an unstable rate, which can lead to the loss of some wildlife 
species in the region. The open ivory market in China is fuelling illegal killings and trafficking of 
wildlife in Africa, which is threatening the existence of some of these species. It is crucial 
to monitor the impacts this illegal killing has on wildlife, as the ecosystem strives to balance the 
wildlife population. As of 1930, the population of wild elephants on the African continent was 
about 10 million. Unfortunately, in just about a century, poaching and conflicts have seriously 
decimated their population. Presently, the number of roaming Elephants across Africa is down to 
about 415,000. It is worth noting that there has been some awareness of the issue in some 
documentaries, but poaching keeps driving elephants and many other wildlife to near extinction. In 
this project, I review existing wildlife poaching literature on East African Elephant conservation
and use this information to build an Agent-based model using NetLogo. The main focus of this 
model is to simulate effective ways to achieve the stable conservation of the continued existence of  
Africaâ€™s gentle giants. The Netlogo software uses complex parameters to visualize the 
outcome in real-time so that researchers, experts, and stakeholders in wildlife conservation can 
monitor poaching variables and act accordingly.
